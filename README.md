The challenge for the user is to enter in the most correct answers before the time runs out.  Incorrect answers penalize the user by 10 seconds per incorrect answer.  Theres a 1 second delay after receiving a correct or incorrect answer input. The code will also notify users if they've chosen the correct or incorrect answer. The code will dynamically create HTML/CSS depending on the users inputs. 
 
 The highscore sheet uses local web storage API whilst using javascript to achieve this.  Subtract time when submitting wrong answers.
